- Open Chrome Canary
- In Chrome Canary, enable the flags:
  `#enable-experimental-web-platform-features` and `#conversion-measurement-api`
- In Chrome canary, open 3 windows/tabs:
  - `chrome://conversions-internals`: to see the impressions and conversions the browser stores
  - `localhost:8080`: the publisher page, wher the add is embedded
  - `localhost:3000`: the report server UI
- In `localhost:8080` (publisher), click the ad. This navigates to the advertiser's page. Click "Add to cart" to convert. In the conversion internals, you should see one impression and one conversion report scheduled.
