# User-Agent 👀 Client Hints

User-Agent Client Hints is a new expansion to the Client Hints API, that enables
developers to access information about a user's browser in a privacy-preserving
and ergonomic way. Client Hints enable developers to actively request
information about the user's device or conditions, rather than needing to parse
it out of the User-Agent (UA) string. Providing this alternative route is the
first step to eventually reducing User-Agent string granularity.

Learn how to update your existing functionality that relies on parsing the
User-Agent string to make use of User-Agent Client Hints instead.
