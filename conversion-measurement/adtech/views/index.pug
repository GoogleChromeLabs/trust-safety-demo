  p *‚ö†Ô∏è This is not the conversion time (= attribution trigger time). This is the time when the reporting endpoint has received this report. This time is displayed here to make it easier to know what reports you're looking at. The exact conversion time (= attribution trigger time) is visible in chrome://conversion-internals, but is not included in the report in order to preserve user privacy.
