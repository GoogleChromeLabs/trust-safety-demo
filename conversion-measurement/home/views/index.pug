            li Use the latest 
                a(href="https://www.google.com/chrome/canary/" noreferrer noopener target="_blank") Chrome Canary or Dev
                |.
            li Don't use Incognito or Guest mode, because the API is disabled on these profiles.
            li Don't block third-party cookies. 
            li Deactivate ad-blocking extensions on the pages where you need to test the API (or create a fresh user profile without extensions). Ad-blocking browser extensions may block some of the API's functionality if script names contain the term "ad".

                span.code.select chrome://flags/#privacy-sandbox-ads-apis

    h2 Run the demo
    p In this demo an advertiser uses an adtech provider to run their ads on a publisher sites. Follow the flow below to see how the API generates 
        span.code.select event-level 
        |and 
        span.code.select aggregatable reports:
    ol
        li First visit the 
            a(href=publisherUrl target="_blank") publisher site
            |  and view and/or click an ad on that site. 
            ol Because this ad is configured with special attribution parameters, a source event is registered. You'll see that either anchor elements or JavaScript calls can be used to generate a source event.
        li Second, either follow the link for a clickable ad or visit the 
            a(href=advertiserUrl target="_blank") advertiser site
            | directly 
        li Third, interact with the product on the 
            a(href=advertiserUrl target="_blank") advertiser site 
            | by visiting the product page, adding the product to your cart, or making a purchase... 
            ol While interacting with the product, the adtech endpoint will be informed. It decides that your actions are conversions, and hence will trigger attributions, with variable trigger data values, for your engagements on the advertiser's site.
            ol After attributions have been triggered, attribution reports are generated and stored in local storage in your browser (on your device). 
        li Finally, open 
            span.code.select chrome://attribution-internals 
            | to inspect the reports that have been generated.
            ol The reports are configured to be sent to the adtech provider configured in Step 1 (which must be the same origin as the adtech mentioned in Step 2 and 3).
