h1 Demo: event-level conversion measurement API
h2 Wait - what is this demo about?
| Event-level API: 
a(href="https://github.com/WICG/conversion-measurement-api") explainer
|.

h2 Before you start:
ul
    li Make sure you're in Chrome Canary.
    li Make sure you've activated the flags 
        span.select.code #enable-experimental-web-platform-features
        |  and 
        span.select.code #conversion-measurement-api
        |.
h2 Ready? 
h3 Open these:
ul
    li 
        a(href=publisherUrl) Publisher website (leading to advertiser website)
    li
        a(href=adtechUrl) Adtech server
    li
        span.select.code chrome://conversion-internals/
p.hint ⚠️ Gotcha: in local development, open  
    span.code 127.0.0.1 
    | (not 
    span.code localhost
    | ). Because conversions and reporting are origin-dependent, and this codebase specifies 
    span.code 127.0.0.1
    |  (see 
    span.code .env 
    | files).

h3 Follow these steps:
| On the 
span.actor-publisher publisher
|  website, an authorized third-party script from 
span.actor-adtech adtech
|  loads an iframe.
|  This iframe includes an ad tag that contains the attributes needed for the conversion measurement API: 
span.code impressiondata
| , 
span.code impressionexpiry
| , 
span.code conversiondestination 
| (an 
span.actor-advertiser advertiser
|  URL) and 
span.code reportingorigin
|  (an 
span.actor-adtech adtech
|  server).
div.do
    | 👁 Open the DevTools (press F12) on the publisher page to see these attributes.
    br
    | 👉 Click the ad.
| Once the ad is clicked, you're taken to the 
span.actor-advertiser advertiser
|'s. An impression event is sent to 
span.actor-browser browser
|  storage. No conversion has happened yet. 
div.do
    | 👁 See the impression event in 
    span.select.code chrome://conversion-internals/
    |  (refresh).
    br
    | 👉 Click the "add to cart" button on the advertiser's page.
| As defined by the 
span.actor-advertiser advertiser
| , this page contains a conversion pixel ( 🟥 ). This triggers a request to the 
span.actor-adtech adtech
|  server, which in turn determines whether a conversion should be registered. If so: the server send a 302 request to the 
span.actor-browser browser
| , who then schedules a conversion report. This report will be sent to the 
span.code reportingorigin
|  defined in the ad tag (typically, the 
span.actor-adtech adtech
|  server).
div.do
    | 👁 See the conversion report in 
    span.select.code chrome://conversion-internals/
    |  (refresh).
    br
    | 👉 Click "send all reports" in the Chrome internals.
    br
    | 👁 See the report data on the 
    a(href=adtechUrl) Adtech server UI
    |  (refresh).
