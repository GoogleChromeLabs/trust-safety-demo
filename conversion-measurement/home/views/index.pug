    h2 Set up your browser
        h3 Browser requirements
        ul
            li Use Chrome version 94 or later. Type 
              span.code.select chrome://version 
              | in the URL bar to see your browser version.
            li Don't use Incognito or Guest mode, because the API is disabled on these profiles.
            li Don't block third-party cookies. 
            li Ensure that the Privacy Sandbox APIs are not disabled at 
              span.code.select chrome://settings/privacySandbox

            li Deactivate ad-blocking extensions on the pages where you need to test the API (or create a fresh user profile without extensions). Ad-blocking browser extensions may block some of the API's functionality if script names contain the term "ad".

            li Open  
                span.code.select chrome://flags

    h2 Run the demo
    p An advertiser uses an adtech provider to run their ads on different publisher sites. Here is a common flow  shown in this demo:
    ol
        li You visit a 
            a(href=publisherUrl target="_blank") publisher site
            |  and view and/or click an ad on that site. Because this ad is configured with special attribution parameters, a source event is registered. Observe that either anchor elements or JavaScript calls can be used to generate a source event.
        li Later on, you visit the 
            a(href=advertiserUrl target="_blank") advertiser site
            | ‚è§the site for which you've viewed and/or clicked an ad at Step 1. 
        li On the advertiser site, you can visit a product page, add a product to your cart, make a purchase... 
        li As you do so, the adtech will be informed. It may decide that your actions are conversions, and hence will trigger different attributions, with different trigger data values, for your different engagements on the advertiser's site.
        li Because the adtech has triggered attributions, attribution reports are generated and stored in your browser (on your device). Open 
            span.code.select chrome://attribution-internals
            | to see the reports.
        li The reports are configured to be sent to the adtech provider configured at Step 1 (which must be the same origin as the adtech mentioned at Step 4 and 5).
