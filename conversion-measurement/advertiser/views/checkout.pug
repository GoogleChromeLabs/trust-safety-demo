  strong On this page: 
  | As defined by the 
  span.actor-advertiser advertiser
  | , this page contains a conversion pixel ( üü• ).
  | Now that you've checked out, you're on this page, and the pixel triggers a request to the 
  span.actor-adtech adtech server
  |. Upon receiving this request, the 
  span.actor-adtech adtech server
  |  determines whether a conversion should be registered and what the conversion value should be.
  | It sends a 302 request to the 
  span.actor-browser browser
  |. Upon receiving this request, the  
  span.actor-browser browser
  |  maps the click and conversion data, and schedules a conversion report.
  p 
  strong Do:
  ul
    li See the conversion report stored by the browser, in 
      span.select.code chrome://conversion-internals
      |  (refresh if needed).
    li (Optional: in 
      span.select.code chrome://conversion-internals
      |, click 
      strong Send All Reports
      |. This sends all the conversion reports immediately to the reporting endpoint, instead
      | of waiting for the browser to send the reports at the scheduled time. This is useful for debugging.
      | You can then see the reports immediately on the 
      a(href=adtechServerUi) adtech server UI
      |.)
    li Open the 
      a(href=adtechServerUi) adtech server UI
      |  to see the reports once the browser has sent them.
    li Then, click the 
      strong Sign up
      |   button here on this page to see what happens when another conversion takes place.
