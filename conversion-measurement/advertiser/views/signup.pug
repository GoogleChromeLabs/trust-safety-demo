      strong On this page: 
      | As defined by the 
      span.actor-advertiser advertiser
      | , this page contains a conversion pixel ( üü• ).
      | Now that you've signed up, you're on this page, and the pixel triggers a request to the 
      span.actor-adtech adtech server
      |. Upon receiving this request, the 
      span.actor-adtech adtech server
      |  determines whether a conversion should be registered and what the conversion value should be.
      | It sends a 302 request to the 
      span.actor-browser browser
      |. Upon receiving this request, the  
      span.actor-browser browser
      |  maps the click and conversion data, and schedules a conversion report.
      p 
      strong Do:
      ul
        li See the conversion report stored by the browser, in 
          span.select.code chrome://conversion-internals
          |  (refresh if needed).
        li (Optional: in 
          span.select.code chrome://conversion-internals
          |, click 
          strong Send All Reports
          |. This sends all the conversion reports immediately to the reporting endpoint, instead
          | of waiting for the browser to send the reports at the scheduled time. This is useful for debugging.
          | You can then see the reports immediately on the 
          a(href=adtechServerUi) adtech server UI
          |.)
        li Open the 
          a(href=adtechServerUi) adtech server UI
          |  to see the reports once the browser has sent them.
